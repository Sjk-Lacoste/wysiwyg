# WYSIWYG Rich Text Editor

Here is my open-source text editor for website, though it's still in its early stage, I will continue adding more features to it.

I used vanilla javaScript without any library or framework

## Installation
In your ```<textarea></textarea>``` tag add an id and initialise it:
```
<textarea id="myEditor"></textarea>
```
and initialise it by the following code in your ```<script></script>``` tags
```
<script>
    textEditor.init({
        selector: 'myEditor'
    });
</script>
```
